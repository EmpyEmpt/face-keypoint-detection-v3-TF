# Face landmark detection

Built using TF and custom CNN architecture

Just a small upgrade (in form of structure and cleanliness) to [this repo](https://github.com/EmpyEmpt/face-keypoint-detection)  

Additionally, repo above has a built Docker image and web-view inference.  

More augmentation, more model optimization, more project structure, such wow, much nice
